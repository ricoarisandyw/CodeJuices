  <b>Codejuices</b> is some random code I learn. I publish my work here with purpose maybe everyone or just one person get my code as great solution for his confusing programming works. Minimal this blog is for me to repeat what I've learn today. Remember, I only repeat it, this blog just random code and not organized but you can ask and I will try give my best. I very loved helping confussed programmer. Let's grow together. <b>Drink our Fresh Code.</b><br>

<h4>
<b>Slogan "Drink our Fresh Code</b></h4>
We will try to keep my fresh code which still hype in public. Programmer lesson is dynamic. If we don't study, we lost. Accelerate of technology usualy make us fear to learn something that may not exist in next 5 years. But don't worry about that. We will serve you with our best fresh code juice.<br>

Logo "C for letter with on top of edge and orange inside and leaf "</h4>
<b>C :&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;C is for Code, why it silver? I inspired by metal color (blender knife)<br>
<b>Orange&nbsp; :</b> Nothing, I just love orange. Why not apple? Because I need round fruit. Why not melon? I back ask, which one is fresh when we look? Orange or Melon? Orange right. Why it has 6 piece orange? Shut up!<br>
<b>Leaf :</b> More nature touch. and I because I like to use Spring Framework.<br>
